## 🧭 How It Works

### Receiver:
- Starts a local Flask server (`/upload`) to accept video frames.
- Generates a QR code containing IP, token, and Receiver ID.
- Displays live feed with mirror view using OpenCV.

### Sender:
- Uses OpenCV to capture video.
- Scans the QR code and connects securely.
- Streams frames to the receiver via HTTP POST.
