## 📖 Overview

**CamDroid** is a local-network camera streaming tool that effortlessly bridges your mobile device (or an additional webcam) and your desktop. It eliminates the need for USB cables by using your local Wi-Fi.

The connection is established using a simple, secure **QR Code scan**, after which video frames are securely streamed over HTTP via a Flask backend to a sleek, modern PyQt5 desktop receiver.

## ✨ Features

- **🚀 Instant QR Pairing**: No typing IP addresses. Just scan the QR code generated by the receiver to instantly connect.
- **🔒 Secure Token Validation**: Each session generates a unique UUID-based token to ensure only your authorized device can stream to your PC.
- **⚡ Low-Latency Local Streaming**: Video frames are transmitted directly over your local network using fast `HTTP POST` requests.
- **🎨 Sleek Desktop GUI**: The receiver boasts a borderless, modern PyQt5 interface with smooth animations and intuitive controls.
- **📱 Cross-Platform Sender**: The sender is built using Kivy, allowing it to be compiled and run seamlessly on Android devices.
- **🔄 Camera Switching**: Easily toggle between front and rear cameras on the sender device.
